# rb-malware-agent

## Overview

This is a tool for query and obtain data from the redBorder's Malware API. There are two types of data that can be obtained:

- IPs scores
- File hashes score

It stores the data on two separated files, one for hashes (files analyzed) and another for IPs that have a score higher than a number that you can specify.

## Usage

Usage of redborder-malware-agent:

```
  -debug
        Print debug info
  -hash_whitelist
        File to add hashes with score < min_score
  -interval int
        Interval in seconds between updates
  -ip_whitelist
        File to add IPs with score < min_score
  -min_score float
        Min score to add to the blacklist (default 50)
  -output string
        Path to save the output files
  -socket_dir string
        Unix socket control directory
  -timeout int
        Socket timeout (default 5)
  -url string
        API url
```

## Examples

If you want to get a file with IP and hashes containing scores greater than 25 you can do the following:

```bash
./agent -url http:10.0.150.77:7777/reputation/v1/malware -min_score 25 -output .
```

You will find the next files:

- `hashes_blacklist`
- `ips_blacklist`

You can also get a whitelist with the flag `-ipWhitelist` or `-hashWhitelist`  

```bash
./agent -url http:10.0.150.77:7777/reputation/v1/malware -ipWhitelist -hashWhitelist -output .
```

So you will get two additional files with scores lower than 25 (in this case)

- `hashes_whitelist`
- `ips_whitelist`

Also if you want notify snort you can provide a UNIX socket to send a message:

```bash
./agent -url http:10.0.150.77:7777/reputation/v1/malware -socket_dir /etc/snort/groupname/cs -output .
```

The application will send a hash reload message to instance 0 (`/etc/snort/groupname/cs/instance-0/SNORT.sock`) and a IP reload notification to all instances (`/etc/snort/groupname/cs/instance-*/SNORT.sock`).
